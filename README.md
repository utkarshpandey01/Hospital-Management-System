# Hospital Management System
This project is genrally based on the entier Management system of Hospital in which we have sub management part like 
1.Patient Management 
2.Doctor Management 
3.Appointment Management 
4.Exit

For managing each management we have diffrent modules for each management system in that module we have entierly worked on creating the database by the help of using dictonaries and list 

In the Patient and Doctors Management we can perform various operations like 
1.Add (Patient/Doctors) 
2.View all (Patients/Doctors)
3.Search (Patient/Doctors) by ID
4.Update (Patients/Doctors)
5.Delete (Patients/Doctors)

Appointment Management System is little diffrent from the patient and doctor management system because in appointment managament system we generall connect both the patient and docotor management system like(for eg.) if a patient is having "Hear Pain" then we will appoint him/her doctor specialized in Cardiology feild 

Apart from this , a patient can view all its appointment by patient ID and also able to see the doctors appointment with other patient and then accordingly cancel the appointment if the doctor is busy
